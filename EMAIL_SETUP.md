# Email Setup Guide

To enable email functionality in your contact forms, you need to set up EmailJS:

## 1. Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

## 2. Create Email Service
1. In your EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the setup instructions
5. Note down your **Service ID**

## 3. Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates"
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template structure:

```
Subject: New message from {{from_name}}

From: {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio contact form.
```

4. Note down your **Template ID**

## 4. Get Public Key
1. Go to "Account" â†’ "General"
2. Find your **Public Key**

## 5. Update Environment Variables
Update your `.env` file with the actual values:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## 6. Test the Contact Form
1. Restart your development server
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Check if emails are received

## Fallback Behavior
If EmailJS is not configured, the form will:
1. Open the user's default email client
2. Pre-fill the email with the form data
3. Allow manual sending

This ensures the contact form always works, even without EmailJS setup.
